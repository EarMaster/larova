# Validate Play Store metadata under fastlane/metadata/android against Google Play's
# per-locale character limits.
#
# Usage:
#   tools/check_store_metadata.sh            # listing text only (title, descriptions)
#   tools/check_store_metadata.sh <code>     # also require changelogs/<code>.txt everywhere
#
# Checked in executable (mode 100755) and invoked by path everywhere — CI, /release, by hand.
# Keep the mode: a plain `git add` of a new tool here will not set it, and a workflow step that
# runs it by path fails with exit 126 rather than with anything that names the real problem.
#
# <code> is the app's versionCode, not the versionName — fastlane names release-note files
# after the versionCode (changelogs/7.txt), which is also what the Play API keys them by.
#
# Every limit Play enforces is per locale and counted in characters, so this checks each
# locale's own file. A translation that grew past the limit is the normal failure mode; the
# English source being short proves nothing about the others.
#
# Exits non-zero and prints every problem it found (not just the first), so one run tells you
# the full list of files to fix.

# English and German at M3, while the app itself is translated into fourteen languages at M4
# (docs/localization.md). The store set is not the res/values-* set and should not be padded out
# to match it — a listing locale with no text publishes blank, whereas a missing in-app string
# falls back to English. Add a locale here only once its listing text actually exists.
